  <h1>{{ site.name }}</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Yifan Hao, a first year master student major in <b>Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign</b>. I received my BS degree from <b>University of Michigan at Ann Arbor</b> and <b>Electrical & Computer Engineering at SJTU</b>. I'm passionate about low level technologies that address performance issues, specifically in interaction between hardware and software (Embedded Design/IoT, OS, Computing System)</p>

  <p>Beyond massive time I devoted to my academic research, I randomly get addicted to games and various sports.</p>
